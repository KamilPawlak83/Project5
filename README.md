# Project5

### Project Description

This Project is my extension to Project5 from 100 Days of Swift by Paul Hudson: https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/Classic/project5

This Game gives You an oportunity to create new words from basic, 8 letters word.
You have to create new words during this rules:
- word must have at least 3 letters and no more than 8.
- word must be real (exist in English language)
- word must be unique
- word can contain only letters from basic word (if We have only one "a" letter We can use it only once )
- word must be diffrent than basic word
- during the game You have to be happy :D

I added several important features like:
* High score for score(points) and used words (I used UserDefaults)
* 2 new VC for highscores lists (score, used words), 
* New game button, 
* New buttons that show Us current score/usedwords and send Us to new controllers (and ToolBar for these buttons)
* I copeed with bug about lowercase letters (Swift and swift now it's the same)


### What We can learn from this code

* TableView and TableViewController
* UserDefaults
* How We can use 2 different segue
* How to sort String values that contains Int (text10.txt should be after text9.txt) 
* ToolBar
* how to add TextField to allertController


### UI example
